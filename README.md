# ðŸ’¼ Welcome to my workspace! 
- This repository showcases my work, including case studies and data/code which showcase my technical skills in data manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I am passionate about **leveraging data to help the world make better (more informed) decisions**.
This may be implemented in various applications, Some include: **optimizing workforce resources, creating data-backed policies or simply transforming data into a legible source**. 
My special sauce is **Highlighting the human element in data transformation and visualization across platforms** to derive actionable insights.

Outside work ðŸ’œ, I enjoy spending time supporting my local community by volunteering across orginizations. From community orgs to city/state orgs and national food banks. Giving back is a critial aspect to ensure that I remain connected, which in-tern supports my [mental] health and creative drive towards exploration and innovation!
When I am not volunteering or spending time with loved ones, I can be found learning from the world around me. From Podcasts, to TedTalks, to getting hands-on with 'the topic of the day' I love learning about people, processes and technology and how I can use those tools to help build a better tomorrow!
Meaning I don't *just* learn for personal gain, I learn to share that knowledge with others in hopes we can collaborate to make the world around me a better place!

Thus, If you have any questions about any of my past/present or future work, or simply would like to chat about a driving a better tomorrow - [shoot me an email](mailto:andrewdasharp@gmail.com); or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asharp27/)- Looking forward to our paths crossing!
