# ðŸ“Š ASharps Portfolio

Welcome to my workspace! This repository showcases my work, including case studies and data/code which showcase my technical skills in data manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am passionate about **leveraging data to help the world make better (more informed) decisions**.
This may be implemented in various applications, Some include: **optimizing workforce resources, creating data-backed policies or simply transforming data into a legible source**. 
My special sauce is **Highlighting the human element in data transformation and visualization across platforms** to derive actionable insights.


This portfolio contains:
- ðŸ“‚ **Project Case Studies** (Markdown files summarizing key projects)
  - Case Study: Optimizing Shift Bidding for Better Time Zone alignment
- ðŸ’» **Code Exaples** (samples of data analysis/ visulization)
  - timegpt-example-cleaned: Time-series forecasting method using timeGPT








Outside work, I enjoy spending time supporting my local community by volunteering across orginizations. From local community to city/state orgs to national food banks. Giving back is a critial aspect to ensure that we remain connected, which in-tern supports my [mental] health and creative drive towards exploration and innovation!
When I am not volunteering or spending time with loved ones, I can be found learning from the world around me. From Podcasts, to TedTalks, to getting hands-on with 'the topic of the day' I love learning about people, processes and technology. However I don't learn for my own personal gain, I learn to share it with others in an effort to make the world around me a better place!
