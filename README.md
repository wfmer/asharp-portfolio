### ‚õ∞Ô∏èOutside work
I enjoy spending time supporting my local community by volunteering across orginizations. Giving back is a critial aspect to ensure that I remain connected, which in-tern supports my creative drive towards exploration and innovation!
When I am not volunteering or spending time with loved ones, I can be found learning from the world around me. From Mentors, Podcasts, to TedTalks or getting hands-on with 'the topic of the day' I love learning about people, processes and technology and how I can use those tools to help build a better tomorrow!


Thus, If you have any questions about any of my past/present or future work, or simply would like to chat about a driving a better tomorrow -[shoot me an email](mailto:andrewdasharp@gmail.com); or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asharp27/)- Looking forward to our paths crossing!
