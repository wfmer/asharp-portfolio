## **Problem Statement**

The existing shift bid system in place allowed agents to bid on any shift regardless of time zone. Meaning the stack-rank was solely based on their performance (as determined by the business). While this ensured fairness in bidding, it often resulted in agents working shifts that were misaligned with their local time zone. 
This led to:

- Agents working extremely early or late relative to business operating hours. 
	- (EX: EST agent working until 8PM; PT agent starting at 5AM)
    
- Gaps in coverage during critical opening and closing hours.
    
- Increased fatigue and lower job satisfaction among agents.
    

## **Process & Analysis**

To better understand the issue, I conducted aÂ **data-driven assessment**Â of:

1. The distribution of agents across different U.S. time zones.
    
2. The number of agents needed to open and close versus where agents were actually located.
    
3. Coverage gaps in mid-morning and closing intervals due to the current shift allocation process.
    

Through discussions with leadership and workforce planning teams, I highlighted inefficiencies in shift coverage and employee dissatisfaction stemming from the unrestricted bidding process.

## **Solution Implementation**

To address these challenges, I proposed aÂ **time zone-based shift bidding system**, where agents would select from a smaller, predefined pool of shifts that aligned more closely with their local time zone. This approach aimed to:

- Improve agent experience by reducing extreme early or late shifts.
    
- Ensure proper staffing coverage for mid-morning and closing intervals.
    
- Balance business needs with employee well-being.
    

### **Execution Steps:**

âœ… Developed a structuredÂ **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document**Â to guide agents through the new process. 
âœ… Defined clearÂ **guardrails and policies**Â to support both employee needs and business objectives. 
âœ… Collaborated with leadership to gain approval and ensure smooth implementation. 
âœ… Communicated changes effectively to agents, providing transparency and addressing concerns proactively.

## **Results & Impact**

ðŸ“ˆÂ **Operational Efficiency**: Improved shift coverage, particularly in mid-morning and closing hours. 
ðŸ˜ŠÂ **Enhanced Agent Experience**: Reduced instances of extreme shift misalignment, leading to better work-life balance. 
ðŸ“ŠÂ **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leadership gained insights into staffing distribution needs, allowing for more informed workforce planning.

- Metrics: We measured the impact of this process improvement by examining SLA compliance in key areas alongside agent reported measurements, caputured in the quartely questionaire.

## **Next Steps & Lessons Learned**

- Possible Improvements: Technical limitations with the WFM software made the implementation a bit cumbersome. Finding another WFM tool, or data analysis tool to do the lifting outside the WFM tool used would provide for added agility and reduce the set-up time required for each bid. However, At the end of the day the implemtenation met the buisness requirements.
    
- Future optimizations: Moving forward optimizations can be made to align with the teams updated structure, reflecting the updated routing customers encounter when initaiting their outreach. Additionally, building in mechansims that reward performance while retaining business needs may help achieve added 'buy-in' from agents.
